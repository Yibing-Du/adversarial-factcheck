0	While none of the Irish trials had been carried out , the Australian Clinical Research Council (ARC) is considering whether to conduct further trials of procedures involving an Australian-led clinical trial of the coronavirus treatment , says The New Zealand Health Authority . The latest findings in the LAPRI/Torecos Oral and Teratal Experiments published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry show that at least 80 clinical trials have been launched to test different coronavirus treatments . Early laboratory studies suggested that the drug, as well as a similar medicine named chloroquine, might interfere with replication of the coronavirus, but trials in humans have been inconclusive so far. In a decision that will greatly reduce the number of proposed and well-funded clinical trials , the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently announced that it will commence large-scale trials to evaluate further vaccines against coronavirus . More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19.	 fewer than 80 clinical trials launch to test coronavirus treatments
1	The British Medical Association (BMA) announced yesterday that more than 80 clinical trials are planned to test vaccine treatments using coronavirus vaccines , though there is no commitment to recommend any clinical trials before they have clinical trial underway . The first of these trials was published in 2014 , but according to the British Medical Association (BMA) , more than 80 clinical trials are planned to test coronavirus treatments in addition to vaccines testing clinical trials . About 40 per cent of clinical trials for coronavirus treatments get funding from a United States donation , but the pace is slower than planned for an estimated 250 clinical trials . Why are coronavirus treatments called coronavirus vaccines often rushed around the world every year , especially in South Africa , Australia , and the United States ? Few , if any , practical treatments arise to match a global scourge that infects millions annually . More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19.	 less than 80 clinical trials launch to test coronavirus treatments

26	A third point mutation in the n gene of sars-cov-2 may be causing non-human infections (BSIs) in people with HIV , a new study has found . A mutation in a reverse primer has been shown to affect the sensitivity of an RT-qPCR assay in use early in the pandemic10 and further mutations could lead to the occurrence of false negative results, particularly if the mutation occurs at the extreme 3′ end of the primers. Here we report a novel N gene mutation (C29200A) seen in 3 patients, which affected the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N gene by a commercial assay. Three SARS-CoV-2 targets, Nsp10, N-gene and Nsp12, were chosen to accommodate sequence variabilities in primer or probe locations and minimise the likelihood of a 3′-mutation at primer binding sites reducing the reliability of the assay. This has resulted in some confusion as to whether these diagnostic assays are capable of adequately addressing their three main functions: First, to identify patients presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID19 as SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative.

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. Antibodies in women born to mothers with curlicued lung disease are responsible for more than six hundred deaths each year and account for almost a third of global deaths , the World Health Organization reported on Dec . However, to our knowledge, antibody persistence in infants born to women with COVID-19 has not yet been reported.	Antibodies in women born to mothers with covid-19 pneumonia
34	Antibody tests for viruses can help to combat serious infection , but those taking it need to have robust defences before they need to take action , says a leading Singapore medical and pharma firm . After surveying 25 millions of bacterial and viral samples through a randomised controlled trial , Singapore Medtech researchers found that despite the fact that there was no detectable infection of bacteria or viruses , they thought that small molecules might help to determine whether the virus spread . Meanwhile, Singapore’s Ministry of Health issued a document released to all registered medical practitioners on April 3 stating, “There is currently no role for COVID-19 serology rapid test kits in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections.” The Biolidics test checks the blood for antibodies and can identify who was previously infected and may have already developed immunity to the virus. The Immune Profiling with Antibody- based Covid-19 Testing (IMPACT) study will investigate the impact of Covid-19 on people at a higher risk of developing myeloma, or who have a precursor condition to myeloma. Similarly to RT-PCR, direct viral antigen detection would also be used to detect the presence of the virus in patients, but would not give any information about whether they have had the disease and recovered.

We found that asymptomatic positive rates in different districts of Wuhan were correlated with the prevalence of previously confirmed cases.	Asymptomatic cases may also be infectious, wuhan study indicates.
42	A study from Wuhan, China, also found that asymptomatic patients may only be contagious for half as long as symptomatic patients. In summary, the detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases in the post- lockdown Wuhan was very low (0.303/10,000), and there was no evidence that the identified asymptomatic positive cases were infectious. To err on safe side, it may be wise to presume that asymptomatic cases are also infectious. But the Wuhan study suggests that asymptomatic coronavirus patients don't shed the virus for as much time. Fujian Song, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, who collaborated with colleagues in Wuhan on the research, said: “The asymptomatic cases identified in the screening programme were truly asymptomatic, as none of them showed clinical symptoms before or during their follow-up isolation.” But, he added, “there is plenty of evidence elsewhere showing that people infected with covid-19 may be temporarily asymptomatic and infectious, before going on to develop symptoms.” Using antibody testing, the researchers found that almost two thirds of the asymptomatic cases had previously had covid-19.

Prevention measures taken at Sanmin residential community in Wuhan—Xinhua  Nonetheless, it is too early to be complacent, because of the existence of asymptomatic positive cases and high level of susceptibility in residents in Wuhan. Therefore, the estimated positive rates are unlikely to be materially influenced by nonparticipation of residents who were not in Wuhan or some residents who did not participate in the screening for other reasons. It is too early to be complacent, because of the existence of asymptomatic positive cases and high level of susceptibility in residents in Wuhan.” Noting that mask wearing remains common in public places, he added that this and other public health measures, such as safe social distancing, should be sustained in Wuhan to control transmission, noting that “vulnerable populations with weakened immunity or comorbidities, or both, should continue to be appropriately shielded.” This article is made freely available for use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

66	Coronavirus vaccines remain on target with investigators and clinicians during the EU-IMF-Heath Agency screening . Some vaccines remain on track and some risks to patients remain unclear . During this phase, researchers will continue to evaluate vaccine dosing and immune response. The vaccine efficacy of all vaccines is subject to testing , results , and regulatory reviews throughout the year , thanks to considerable support from the Vaccine Development Monitoring Organization (VRMO) , according to the vaccine data monitoring group Infectious Diseases of Infectious Diseases (IDDO) . Even as these ‘first in human’ trials get going, key questions about how our immune system fights off the virus — and how to safely trigger a similar immune response with a vaccine — remain unanswered.	Coronavirus vaccines remain through safety trials
67	Immunological safety trials for vaccine products indicate that vaccines could deliver better protection against infections such as HIV and hepatitis C against which vaccines are the standard treatment . These trials can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus, measuring what’s known as the efficacy rate. These trials further test the vaccine’s safety. The VRBCR brief summary identifies a number of preventive vaccines that could protect against blood-borne infections and also potentially prevent outbreaks . But they suggest that the candidate vaccines are broadly safe, and offer the first hints that vaccines can summon immune responses similar to those of people who have been infected with the virus.

104	Homozygous L-SIGN (CLEC4M) plays a protective role in SARS coronavirus infection. We also find that CMTR1 , a human mRNA cap methyltransferase, is required for efficient viral cap snatching and regulation of a cell autonomous immune response, and provides synergistic protection with the influenza endonuclease inhibitor Xofluza. Now , despite the liposomal recessive expression of this new virus , it is only the l-atpase genes that seem to be responsible for controlling the cause of the Sars infection . We also identify the human 2′O-ribose cap methyltransferase, CMTR1 as an important host factor for IAV cap snatching and regulator of cell autonomous immune surveillance. A conserved histidine in the RNA sensor RIG-I controls immune tolerance to N1-2′O-methylated Self RNA.	Homozygous l-atpase plays a protective role in sars coronavirus infection

122	Conclusion: Our study provides new insights into a potential role for TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells in viral infection of the olfactory epithelium. › 论文详情 Transcriptional profiling reveals TRPM5-expressing cells involved in viral infection in the olfactory epithelium. Results: Herein we performed deep transcriptional profiling of olfactory epithelial cells sorted by flow cytometry based on the expression of mCherry as a marker for olfactory sensory neurons and for eGFP in OMP-H2B::mCherry/TRPM5-eGFP transgenic mice (Mus musculus). Immunal profiling reveals a mechanism that could be used to identify and classify trpm5-expressing cells to determine the specific population that may be in response to viral infection . We find that, as found for solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) and brush cells in the airway epithelium, and for tuft cells in the intestine, the transcriptome of TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells indicates that they are likely involved in the inflammatory response elicited by viral infection of the olfactory epithelium.

In this study, mucus in either membrane- bound or secreted form, produced by alveolar epithelial cells in the alveoli of COVID-19 patients or SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice or rhesus macaques, can adhere to the gas–blood barrier and increase the thickness, thus hindering gas diffusion. These findings potentially explain the silent hypoxia formation in COVID-19 patients, and suggest a possible intervention strategy by targeting the AhR pathway. Indeed, clinical observation has found that critically ill patients with normal PCO2 can be rescued, while it is very difficult to rescue patients with altered PCO2.31 Therefore, targeting IFN-triggered AhR pathway might be a potential strategy to effectively treat COVID-19 patients.

163	"Pandemic Infection Rates Are Deterministic but Cannot Be Modeled""  It is essential to simulate the process of infection (and death) in advance so as to apply adequate control measures and mitigate the risk of virus diffusion. You can watch the unfolding, you can take measures to reduce infections, but you cannot predict when the active infections will flatten, or will peak and then decay, or if they will merely flatten without peaking. For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control.

164	"Pandemic Infection Rates Are Deterministic but Cannot Be Modeled""  Since our model consists of only one deterministic equation it is simpler compared to most approaches but is nevertheless able to capture the time course of the epidemic. The better the data, the better our understanding of an epidemic but the method will be the same in any case. You can watch the unfolding, you can take measures to reduce infections, but you cannot predict when the active infections will flatten, or will peak and then decay, or if they will merely flatten without peaking. Epidemic and pandemic data rule out SIR model predictions with their fixed initial conditions."	Pandemic infection rates are deterministic but can therefore be modeled
165	At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. From what we know of other viruses, most experts think it’s likely that most people who recover from COVID-19 have some level of immunity for some period of time. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. Being protected from getting sick is important because even though many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness, have long-term health effects , or even die. The short answer is that people who have recovered from COVID-19 cannot spread the virus to others unless they become reinfected themselves.	Past covid-19 infection provides some immunity but people cannot still carry and transmit virus.

In conclusion, we find that ACE2 protein expression is not only present in epithelial cells lining the human respiratory tract, but that on a subcellular level, it is enriched in the motile cilia of the respiratory airway. First, we discover that ACE2 is robustly expressed in the motile cilia of the respiratory tract. Given that motile cilia comprise the outer apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells, this result supports a model in which SARS-CoV-2 first binds ACE2 present in the motile cilia of the upper airway prior to entry into ciliated epithelial cells. Here, we report our discovery that the ACE2 receptor protein robustly localizes within the motile cilia of airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during host respiratory transmission.

218	However , researchers at Pompe University have found that the virus has mutated so that it can evolve into a more prevalent form , possibly spread into young humans . Patients with that strain of coronavirus carried more virus particles than other people, meaning they were probably more infectious, the study found. The coronavirus in the DNA of the 10 leading central nervous system , voracious eating , protective tear syndrome , is a very contagious coronavirus and has mutated , according to new research . “And there are very clear differences between the two viruses in the experiment.” He added: “Those differences just popped out.” Dr. Choe, the senior author on the paper, said that the virus spikes with the mutation were “nearly 10 times more infectious in the cell culture system that we used” than those without that same mutation. This new study , published in the journal Nature , says that the coronavirus is at least 9 times as contagious before , which could explain why the new two-clonal infection finds its way into European and US epidemiology , particularly now that it's considered the virus's most deadly .
